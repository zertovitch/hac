HAC - HAC Ada Compiler
======================

  HAC is perhaps the first open-source (albeit very partial) Ada
  compiler (and virtual machine interpreter) fully programmed in Ada itself.
  Note: HAC was not written from scratch, but is based on a renovation of
  SmallAda, a system developped around 1990 and abandoned since then.

Objectives
==========

    - Fun!
    - Have a simple, quick Ada compiler and execution tool.
    - Be useful for small Ada sandboxed prototypes.
    - Produce the smallest Hello-world executable!
    - Have a tool for script-like jobs (avoid long
        programming-compiling-binding-linking-running cycles).
    - Stay Ada-compatible (HAC programs can be compiled
        and run by other Ada compilers, currently through
        the compatibility package HAT).

  HAC will most probably never be a complete compiler.

Warning & legal
===============

  There is NO WARRANTY in this software.
  Read copyright notice and license in hac_sys.ads .
  The license is the open-source license MIT.

Getting started
===============

  Assuming you have the GNAT (*) compiler installed, do the
  following from a command line interpreter (please replace
  '\' by '/' on Unix-like platforms):

      gnatmake -P hac
      cd exm
      ..\hac gallery.adb

  If `gnatmake` doesn't work, try `gprbuild`.
  Alternatively, on Windows and with mouse only, you can go
  into the "exm" folder and double-click "e.cmd" .

  The program "gallery.adb" will run a bunch of demos that
  are located in the "exm" directory.
  You can test HAC on any other example of course (the "*.adb"
  files in the "exm" and "test" directories).
  As a bonus, you can build some examples with GNAT to compare the output.
  You can do it easily with the hac_exm.gpr project file.
  Since hac_exm.gpr is a text file, you can see there the progress
  (or the lack thereof) in the pieces of Ada code that are really
  working with HAC. See the "Limitations" section below as well.
  ___
  (*) On Debian-based Linuxes like Ubuntu, GNAT is part of the standard
  packages. For other systems, you can get GNAT from AdaCore's Web site:
  https://www.adacore.com/community or from other sites providing GCC
  (the GNU Compiler Collection) with Ada support.
  Check http://www.getadanow.com/ for instance.

Directories

   save_modif.hac      backup program

Documentation
=============

   hac.txt                             this file
   HAC Ada Compiler User Manual.pdf    an 80+ pages user manual
   hac_work.xls                        Excel workbook containing, notably,
                                         a bug list and a "to-do" list and
                                         a "done" (history) list

Some design points
==================

  - HAC reads Ada sources from any stream. In addition to files, it is able
      to read from a Zip archive (plan is to have sets with many sources
      like libraries in Zip files, for instance), from an internet stream,
      from an editor buffer (see the LEA project), from a source stored in
      memory, etc.
  - HAC Ada source file naming follows the GNAT convention: "parent-child.ads"
      for specification and "parent-child.adb" for body. An exception for
      HAC is the main program, where the extension can be anything. We
      recommend using ".hac" for programs that are meant to be principally
      executed through HAC. That way you can associate the ".hac" extension
      with the "hac[.exe]" excecutable on your operating system or your
      file explorer.
  - One goal is to complement or challenge GNAT, for instance in terms of
      compilation speed, or object code compactness, or useability on
      certain targets or for certain purposes (like scripting jobs).
  - HAC could theoretically be also used for tuning run-time performance;
      this would require compiling on other targets than p-code, that is,
      real machine code for various platforms.

To-do list
==========

  The to-do list is located in the spreadsheet "To do", within the
  workbook "doc/hac_work.xls".

Language subset
===============

  HAC supports a small subset of the Ada language. On the other hand,
  Ada is very large, so even a small subset could already fit your needs.
  There is a growing list of programs that are working (in the meaning:
  the compilation succeeds and the execution gives a correct output).
  They are located in the "exm" directory and subdirectories (except
  the "not_working" one), as well as in the "test" subdirectory.

  The available Ada language subset supported by HAC is so far, roughly,
  the "Pascal subset", plus tasking, plus packages, less pointers.
  From a different perspective, HAC supports Ada 83, less pointers,
  less generics, less unconstrained types, plus a few items from
  later Ada versions: 95, 2005, 2012 and 2022.
  Since each Ada version is compatible with previous ones,
  one can say simply that HAC is a subset of Ada 2022.
  
    - Recursion and nested subprograms are supported.
    - You can define your own data types: enumerations, records, arrays
        (and every combination of records and arrays).
    - Only constrained types are supported (unconstrained types are
        Ada-only types and not in the "Pascal subset" anyway).
    - The "String" type (unconstrained) is implemented in a very limited
        way. So far you can only define fixed-sized constants,
        variables, types, record fields with it, like:
          Digitz : constant String (1..10) := "0123456789";
        ... output them with Put, Put_Line, do comparisons and
        concatenations with expressions of the VString variable-length
        string type.
        For general string manipulation, the most practical way with
        the current versions of HAC is to use the VString's.
    - There are no pointers (access types) and nor heap allocation,
        but you will be surprised how far you can go without pointers!
    - Subprograms names cannot be overloaded, although some *predefined*
        subprograms, including operators, of the Standard or the
        HAT package, are overloaded many times, like
        "Put", "Get", "+", "&", ...
    - Programmable modularity (packages or subprograms that you
        can "with") is implemented.
        See exm/unit_a.adb for an example with subprograms as modules.
        See exm/prc.adb for an example with packages as modules.
        See exm/pkg_demo.adb for a larger example with packages.
    - Generics are not yet implemented.
    - Tasks are implemented, but not fully working yet (they used to
        work on SmallAda). See in exm/tasking for what is working
        and exm/not_working for what is not.
    - Small parts of the standard Ada library are available indirectly
        through the HAT, Interfaces and Standard built-in packages.
        You can see the currently available HAT items in its
        specification, src/hat.ads .

  A systematic testing is done in the "test" directory, via
  the all_silent_tests.adb test suite.

History of HAC
==============

    - Now:  HAC is being made more and more usable for real applications,
              with Ada compatibility, modularity, a library with I/O,
              system subprograms,...
    - 2020: Presentation at FOSDEM's Ada Developer Room:
              https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ada_hac/ .
              Starting a bit more serious testing and code cleanup.
    - 2013: January 24th: Day One of HAC: Hello World, Fibonacci
              and other tests work!
    - 2009: A bit further trying to make the translation of SmallAda sources
              succeed (P2Ada was improved on the way, for WITH statements
              and UCSD/Turbo/Delphi-style modularity)...
    - 1999: Automatic translation of Mac Pascal SmallAda sources
              to Ada, using P2Ada.
    - 1989: SmallAda is derived from CoPascal; works only within two
              very system-dependent environments (a Mac GUI, a DOS GUI);
              two similar source sets in two Pascal dialects (Mac Pascal,
              Turbo Pascal).
    - 1986: CoPascal (Schoening).
    - 1975: Pascal-S (Wirth)
              Reference: PASCAL-S, a subset and its implementation
              https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-000147073

  Authors of SmallAda (in Pascal):
    1990 Manuel A. Perez               Macintosh version
    1990 Arthur V. Lopes               integrated environment for IBM-PC
    1989 Arthur V. Lopes               window-oriented monitoring for IBM-PC
    1988 Stuart Cramer and Jay Kurtz   refinement of tasking model
    1987 Frederick C. Hathorn          conversion of CoPascal

  Author of CoPascal (derived from Niklaus Wirth's Pascal-S)
    1986 Charles Schoening

  You can find the SmallAda sources and examples in the "archeology" folder.
  The Turbo Pascal sources files are smaller than the Mac Pascal ones,
  probably because of the memory constraints of the 16-bit DOS system.
  So the Turbo Pascal sources are especially cryptic and sparsely commented,
  full with magic numbers and 1-letter variables, many of them global - ouch!
