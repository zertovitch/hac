HAC - the Hacker's Ada Compiler
===============================

Alternative name: Hello-world Ada Compiler

Objectives:
===========
 - fun!
 - produce the smallest Hello-world executable!

What HAC will never be:
=======================
 - a real, serious Ada compiler - there are enough serious ones!
 - a complete compiler - only a small subset will be covered

History:
========

- 2009: a bit further...
- 1999: translated Mac Pascal sources to Ada
- 1989: SmallAda is derived from CoPascal; works only inside
          very system-dependent environments (a Mac GUI, a DOS GUI)
