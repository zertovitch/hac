HAC - HAC Ada Compiler
======================

Alternative names: Hacker's Ada Compiler, Hello-world Ada Compiler

HAC is perhaps the first open-source (albeit partial) Ada compiler
fully programmed in Ada itself.

Objectives:
===========
 - fun!
 - produce the smallest Hello-world executable!

What HAC will most probably never be:
=====================================
 - a real, serious Ada compiler - there are enough serious ones!
 - a complete compiler - only a subset is covered

Warning & legal
===============
There is NO WARRANTY in this software. Read copyright notice in hac.ads

Some design points
==================
- HAC reads Ada sources from any stream. In addition to files, it is able
    to read from Zip archive (plan is to have sets with many sources like
    libraries in Zip files, for instance), from an internet stream, from
    an editor buffer, from a source stored in memory, etc.
- one goal is to complement or challenge GNAT, for instance in terms of
    compilation speed, or run-time performance of certain portions of code,
    or object code compactness, or useability on certain targets.

History:
========

- 2013: January 24th: Hello World, Fibonacci and other tests work!
- 2009: a bit further trying to make it work...
- 1999: automatic translation of Mac Pascal sources to Ada
- 1989: SmallAda is derived from CoPascal; works only inside
          very system-dependent environments (a Mac GUI, a DOS GUI)

  Authors of SmallAda (in Pascal):
    1990 Manuel A. Perez               Macintosh version
    1990 Arthur V. Lopes               integrated environment for IBM-PC
    1989 Arthur V. Lopes               window-oriented monitoring for IBM-PC
    1988 Stuart Cramer and Jay Kurtz   refinement of tasking model
    1987 Frederick C. Hathorn          conversion of CoPascal

  Author of CoPascal (derived from Pascal-S by Niklaus Wirth)
    1986 Charles Schoening
